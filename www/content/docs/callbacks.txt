h1. <%= @page.title %>

DataMapper implements a series of before and after callback hooks for you to use to call your own code whenever you create, save, update or destroy a record. You might use this to sanitize certain values, or generate values that you don't want users to directly access -- say a salt to mix in with an encrypted password.

Before and after callbacks are defined for:

* Materialize (pulling a record from the DB)
* Create
* Save
* Validation
* Update
* Destroy

h2. Adding a Callback

Callbacks are declared inside your model. There are multiple ways of adding a callback. Each behaves slightly differently.

h3. Block or Procs

Blocks and Procs are not evaluated inside the model instance. Instead they are passed a reference to the model. You should be aware of this if you need to access private methods, in which case you need to set the callbacks using a symbol or string.

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
class Post < DataMapper::Base
  before_save do |post|
    logger.info("We are saving the post")
    true
  end
  
  before_destroy Proc.new {|post| logger.info("We are destroying the post #{post.name}"); true}
end
</coderay>
</notextile>

h3. Symbol or String

Symbols and Strings are treated as a reference to a method inside your model. 

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
class Post < DataMapper::Base
  after_validation :log_success
  
  def log_success
    logger.info("YAY!") if errors.empty?
    true
  end
end
</coderay>
</notextile>

h2. True to Go, False to Stop

Callbacks have to return true else the relevant action will be halted. For example if you use a before_save callback and fail to return true, the record will not save. 

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
class Post < DataMapper::Base
  # This record will save properly
  before_save do |post|
    true
  end
  
  # But it will not be destroyed
  before_destroy do |post|
    false
  end
end
</coderay>
</notextile>
