h1. <%= @page.title %>

If you've followed the "install instructions":/getting_started.html but run into problems, you can find some tips below. At the moment DataMapper is still quite young, so the install process isn't 100% bullet proof... yet!

h2(newRelease). Windows Users

p(newRelease). At present, "DataObjects":http://dataobjects.devjavu.com/ does not run well on Windows natively <br>and will require you to install cygwin or another linux-like <br>environment.  People have been able to get it installed and running <br>on Windows but with severe drops in performance.  This is a known <br>issue and we're working on it.

h2. Dependencies

First port of call if you're having issues with an installation is to make sure you have all the dependencies installed. Rubygems should take care of this for you, but just in case, make sure you have the following gems as well:

* fastthread
* json
* validatable
* rspec - for running specs on DataMapper itself

h2(#trunk). Using Trunk

You will also need to install the DataObject gem and the adaptor for your platform

<notextile>
<coderay lang="bash" line_numbers="inline">
$ sudo gem install data_objects
$ sudo gem install do_mysql
</coderay>
</notextile>

The current database adaptors are:

* do_mysql
* do_sqlite3
* do_postgres

h2. Getting Help

If you still have issues, we suggest getting onto the "mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/datamapper or the "IRC channel":irc://irc.freenode.net/#datamapper and asking around. There's friendly people there to help you out.
