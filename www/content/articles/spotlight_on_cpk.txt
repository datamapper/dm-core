For those of us who have taken a course on database design in college or university, you may have run across a concept called 'Composite Primary Keys' (or sometimes 'Compound Keys' or 'Concatenated Keys', and abbreviated CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s).  It's usually right before you tackle JOINs and right after you fight with the "surrogate key" or "primary key" concept.

Boiling CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s down, they're just a way of identifying a row by multiple keys rather than one.  So instead of an auto_incrementing "serial" primary key (as in @id@), you'd have a combination of @some_column@ and @some_other_column@ that would uniquely identify a row.

CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s aren't as prevalent in the Rails world as Serial Keys (such as the auto-incrementing @:id@ column), but if you're going to support legacy, integration or reporting databases or just de-normalized schemas for performance reasons, they can be invaluable. So sure, Surrogate Keys are a great convenience, but sometimes they just aren't an option.

Let's briefly take a look at how a few ruby ORMs support Composite Primary Keys and then we'll talk about DataMapper's support for CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s.

h2. ActiveRecord

In short, ActiveRecord doesn't support CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s without the help of an external library.  "Dr. Nic Williams":http://drnicwilliams.com/about/ "Composite Keys":http://compositekeys.rubyforge.org/ is an effort to overcome this limitation.

h2. Sequel

Unlike ActiveRecord, Sequel supports CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s natively:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
class Post < Sequel::Model
  set_primary_key [:category, :title]
end
  
post = Post['ruby', 'hello world']
post.pk # => ['ruby', 'hello world']
<% end %>

h2. DataMapper

The latest DataMapper was designed from the ground up to support CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
class Pig
  include DataMapper::Resource
  property :id, Fixnum, :key => true
  property :slug, String, :key => true
  property :name, String
end

Pig.get(1, 'Porky')
Pig[2, 'Piglet']

pig.key # => [1, 'Wilbur']
<% end %>

We declared our keys by adding the @:key => true@ to the appropriate properties. The order is important as it will determine the order keys are addressed throughout the system.

Next, we mixed and matched the keys' types.  @:id@ is a Fixnum, but @:slug@ is a String. DataMapper didn't flinch when we defined a key column as a String because it supports "Natural Keys":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key as well.

Lastly, when retrieving rows via @get@ and @[]@ with a CPK(Composite Primary Keys), we supplied the keys in the order they were defined within our model.  For example, we defined @:id@ first, then @:slug@ second; later, we retrieved Porky by specifying his @:id@ and @:slug@ in the same order.  Additionally, when we asked Wilbur for his keys, he handed us an array in the order the keys were defined.

We didn't need to mix in an external library to get support for CPK(Composite Primary Keys)s, nor did we need to call a @set_primary_key@ method and then supply more than one key to it. DataMapper supports Composite Primary Keys intuitively and without compromise!

In later "Spotlight On..." articles, we'll examine and demonstrate other DataMapper features or persistence concepts as well as compare similar features with other ORMs or libraries.
