=== I don't want to use :id as a primary key, but I don't see
=== <tt>set_primary_key</tt> anywhere. What do I do?

If you're working with a table that doesn't have a <tt>:id</tt> column, you
can declare your properties as you usually do, and declare one of them as a
natural key.

   property :name, String, :key => true

You should now be able to do <tt>Class['name_string']</tt> as well. Remember:
this column should be unique, so treat it that way. This is the equivalent to
using <tt>set_primary_key</tt> in ActiveRecord.


=== How do I make a model paranoid?

  property :deleted_at, DateTime

If you've got deleted_at, your model is paranoid auto-magically. All of your
calls to <tt>##all()</tt>, <tt>##first()</tt>, and <tt>##count()</tt> will be
scoped with <tt>where deleted_at is null</tt>. Plus, you won't see deleted
objects in your associations.

=== Does DataMapper support Has Many Through?

Write me!

=== What about Self-Referential Has And Belongs to Many?

Sure does.  Here's an example implementation:

  class Task
    include DataMapper::Resource
    many_to_many :tasks,
      :join_table => "task_relationships", :left_foreign_key => "parent_id",
      :right_foreign_key => "child_id"
  end

You'll notice that instead of <tt>foreign_key</tt> and
<tt>association_foreign_key</tt>, DataMapper uses the "database-y" terms
<tt>left_foreign_key</tt>, and <tt>right_foreign_key</tt>.

=== Does DataMapper do Single Table Inheritance?

Oh yes, and particularly well too.

  class Person
    include DataMapper::Resource
    property :type, Class ## other shared properties here
  end

  class Salesperson < Person; end

You can claim a column to have the type <tt>:class</tt> and DataMapper will
automatically drop the class name of the inherited classes into that column of
the database.

=== What about Class Table Inheritance?

Class Table Inheritance is on the drawing board and everyone's drooling over
it. So no, not yet, but soon.

=== How do I run my own commands?

You're probably asking for <tt>find_by_sql</tt>, and DataMapper has that in
it's ActiveRecordImpersonation, but if you want to go straight-up DataMapper,
you'll want to use <tt>repository.query</tt>

  repository.query("select * from users where clue > 0")

This does not return any Users (har har), but rather Struct's that will quack
like Users. They'll be read-only as well.

<tt>repository.query</tt> shouldn't be used if you aren't expecting a result set
back.  If you want to just execute something against the database, use
<tt>repository.execute</tt> instead.

=== Can I batch-process a ton of records at once?

  User.each(:performance_rating => "low") do |u|
    u.employment_status = "fired" 
    u.save
  end

With ActiveRecord, doing a <tt>User.find(:all).each{}</tt> would execute the
find, instantiate an object for EVERY result, THEN apply your transformations
to each object in turn. Doesn't sound too horrible unless you have a TON of
records; you WILL grind your system to a screeching and bloody halt.

DataMapper's <tt>#each</tt> works in sets of 500 so the amount of objects
instantiated at a time won't make your computer think it's a victim in a Saw
movie. Once it's done executing your block on the first set of 500, it moves
on to the next.

What's more is <tt>#each</tt> is secretly a finder too. You can pass it an
options hash and it'll only iterate on 500-item sets matching your query.
Don't send it <tt>:offset</tt> though, because that's how it pages. You can
overload the page size by sending it <tt>:limit</tt>

=== Can I get an SQL log of what queries DataMapper is issuing?

Yup, when you issue <tt>Repository.setup</tt>, tack on the <tt>log_stream</tt>
and <tt>log_level</tt>:

  DataMapper::Repository.setup({
   :adapter    => 'mysql', :host       => 'localhost', :username   => 'root',
   :password   => 'R00tPaswooooord', :database   =>
   'myspiffyblog_development', :log_stream => 'log/sql.log', :log_level  => 0
  })

By supplying the <tt>log_stream</tt> you're telling DataMapper what file you
want to see your sql logs in. <tt>log_level</tt> is the
Logger[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/] level of output you
want to see there. 0, in this case, says that you want to see all DEBUG level
messages (and higher) sent to the logger. For more information on how to work
with Logger[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/], hit up
http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/.

Incidentally, if you'd like to send a message into the DataMapper logger, do:

  repository.adapter.logger.info "your message here"
