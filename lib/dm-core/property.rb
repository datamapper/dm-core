module DataMapper
  # = Properties
  # Properties for a model are not derived from a database structure, but
  # instead explicitly declared inside your model class definitions. These
  # properties then map (or, if using automigrate, generate) fields in your
  # repository/database.
  #
  # If you are coming to DataMapper from another ORM framework, such as
  # ActiveRecord, this may be a fundamental difference in thinking to you.
  # However, there are several advantages to defining your properties in your
  # models:
  #
  # * information about your model is centralized in one place: rather than
  #   having to dig out migrations, xml or other configuration files.
  # * use of mixins can be applied to model properties: better code reuse
  # * having information centralized in your models, encourages you and the
  #   developers on your team to take a model-centric view of development.
  # * it provides the ability to use Ruby's access control functions.
  # * and, because DataMapper only cares about properties explicitly defined
  #   in your models, DataMapper plays well with legacy databases, and shares
  #   databases easily with other applications.
  #
  # == Declaring Properties
  # Inside your class, you call the property method for each property you want
  # to add. The only two required arguments are the name and type, everything
  # else is optional.
  #
  #   class Post
  #     include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #     property :title,   String,  :required => true  # Cannot be null
  #     property :publish, Boolean, :default => false  # Default value for new records is false
  #   end
  #
  # By default, DataMapper supports the following primitive (Ruby) types
  # also called core properties:
  #
  # * Boolean
  # * Class (datastore primitive is the same as String. Used for Inheritance)
  # * Date
  # * DateTime
  # * Decimal
  # * Float
  # * Integer
  # * Object (marshalled out during serialization)
  # * String (default length is 50)
  # * Text (limit of 65k characters by default)
  # * Time
  #
  # == Limiting Access
  # Property access control is uses the same terminology Ruby does. Properties
  # are public by default, but can also be declared private or protected as
  # needed (via the :accessor option).
  #
  #  class Post
  #   include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title, String, :accessor => :private    # Both reader and writer are private
  #    property :body,  Text,   :accessor => :protected  # Both reader and writer are protected
  #  end
  #
  # Access control is also analogous to Ruby attribute readers and writers, and can
  # be declared using :reader and :writer, in addition to :accessor.
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title, String, :writer => :private    # Only writer is private
  #    property :tags,  String, :reader => :protected  # Only reader is protected
  #  end
  #
  # == Overriding Accessors
  # The reader/writer for any property can be overridden in the same manner that Ruby
  # attr readers/writers can be.  After the property is defined, just add your custom
  # reader or writer:
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title, String
  #
  #    def title=(new_title)
  #      raise ArgumentError if new_title != 'Lee is l337'
  #      super(new_title)
  #    end
  #  end
  #
  # Calling super ensures that any validators defined for the property are kept active.
  #
  # == Lazy Loading
  # By default, some properties are not loaded when an object is fetched in
  # DataMapper. These lazily loaded properties are fetched on demand when their
  # accessor is called for the first time (as it is often unnecessary to
  # instantiate -every- property -every- time an object is loaded).  For
  # instance, DataMapper::Property::Text fields are lazy loading by default,
  # although you can over-ride this behavior if you wish:
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title, String  # Loads normally
  #    property :body,  Text    # Is lazily loaded by default
  #  end
  #
  # If you want to over-ride the lazy loading on any field you can set it to a
  # context or false to disable it with the :lazy option. Contexts allow
  # multiple lazy properties to be loaded at one time. If you set :lazy to
  # true, it is placed in the :default context
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title,   String                                    # Loads normally
  #    property :body,    Text,   :lazy => false                    # The default is now over-ridden
  #    property :comment, String, :lazy => [ :detailed ]            # Loads in the :detailed context
  #    property :author,  String, :lazy => [ :summary, :detailed ]  # Loads in :summary & :detailed context
  #  end
  #
  # Delaying the request for lazy-loaded attributes even applies to objects
  # accessed through associations. In a sense, DataMapper anticipates that
  # you will likely be iterating over objects in associations and rolls all
  # of the load commands for lazy-loaded properties into one request from
  # the database.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   Widget.get(1).components
  #     # loads when the post object is pulled from database, by default
  #
  #   Widget.get(1).components.first.body
  #     # loads the values for the body property on all objects in the
  #     # association, rather than just this one.
  #
  #   Widget.get(1).components.first.comment
  #     # loads both comment and author for all objects in the association
  #     # since they are both in the :detailed context
  #
  # == Keys
  # Properties can be declared as primary or natural keys on a table.
  # You should a property as the primary key of the table:
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #  property :id,        Serial                # auto-incrementing key
  #  property :legacy_pk, String, :key => true  # 'natural' key
  #
  # This is roughly equivalent to ActiveRecord's <tt>set_primary_key</tt>,
  # though non-integer data types may be used, thus DataMapper supports natural
  # keys. When a property is declared as a natural key, accessing the object
  # using the indexer syntax <tt>Class[key]</tt> remains valid.
  #
  #   User.get(1)
  #      # when :id is the primary key on the users table
  #   User.get('bill')
  #      # when :name is the primary (natural) key on the users table
  #
  # == Indices
  # You can add indices for your properties by using the <tt>:index</tt>
  # option. If you use <tt>true</tt> as the option value, the index will be
  # automatically named. If you want to name the index yourself, use a symbol
  # as the value.
  #
  #   property :last_name,  String, :index => true
  #   property :first_name, String, :index => :name
  #
  # You can create multi-column composite indices by using the same symbol in
  # all the columns belonging to the index. The columns will appear in the
  # index in the order they are declared.
  #
  #   property :last_name,  String, :index => :name
  #   property :first_name, String, :index => :name
  #      # => index on (last_name, first_name)
  #
  # If you want to make the indices unique, use <tt>:unique_index</tt> instead
  # of <tt>:index</tt>
  #
  # == Inferred Validations
  # If you require the dm-validations plugin, auto-validations will
  # automatically be mixed-in in to your model classes: validation rules that
  # are inferred when properties are declared with specific column restrictions.
  #
  #   class Post
  #     include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #     property :title, String, :length => 250, :min => 0, :max => 250
  #     # => infers 'validates_length :title'
  #
  #     property :title, String, :required => true
  #     # => infers 'validates_present :title'
  #
  #     property :email, String, :format => :email_address
  #     # => infers 'validates_format :email, :with => :email_address'
  #
  #     property :title, String, :length => 255, :required => true
  #     # => infers both 'validates_length' as well as 'validates_present'
  #     #    better: property :title, String, :length => 1..255
  #   end
  #
  # This functionality is available with the dm-validations gem. For more information
  # about validations, check the documentation for dm-validations.
  #
  # == Default Values
  # To set a default for a property, use the <tt>:default</tt> key. The
  # property will be set to the value associated with that key the first time
  # it is accessed, or when the resource is saved if it hasn't been set with
  # another value already. This value can be a static value, such as 'hello'
  # but it can also be a proc that will be evaluated when the property is read
  # before its value has been set. The property is set to the return of the
  # proc. The proc is passed two values, the resource the property is being set
  # for and the property itself.
  #
  #   property :display_name, String, :default => lambda { |resource, property| resource.login }
  #
  # Word of warning.  Don't try to read the value of the property you're setting
  # the default for in the proc.  An infinite loop will ensue.
  #
  # == Embedded Values (not implemented yet)
  # As an alternative to extraneous has_one relationships, consider using an
  # EmbeddedValue.
  #
  # == Property options reference
  #
  #  :accessor            if false, neither reader nor writer methods are
  #                       created for this property
  #
  #  :reader              if false, reader method is not created for this property
  #
  #  :writer              if false, writer method is not created for this property
  #
  #  :lazy                if true, property value is only loaded when on first read
  #                       if false, property value is always loaded
  #                       if a symbol, property value is loaded with other properties
  #                       in the same group
  #
  #  :default             default value of this property
  #
  #  :allow_nil           if true, property may have a nil value on save
  #
  #  :key                 name of the key associated with this property.
  #
  #  :field               field in the data-store which the property corresponds to
  #
  #  :length              string field length
  #
  #  :format              format for autovalidation. Use with dm-validations plugin.
  #
  #  :index               if true, index is created for the property. If a Symbol, index
  #                       is named after Symbol value instead of being based on property name.
  #
  #  :unique_index        true specifies that index on this property should be unique
  #
  #  :auto_validation     if true, automatic validation is performed on the property
  #
  #  :validates           validation context. Use together with dm-validations.
  #
  #  :unique              if true, property column is unique. Properties of type Serial
  #                       are unique by default.
  #
  #  :precision           Indicates the number of significant digits. Usually only makes sense
  #                       for float type properties. Must be >= scale option value. Default is 10.
  #
  #  :scale               The number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point.
  #                       Only makes sense for float type properties. Must be > 0.
  #                       Default is nil for Float type and 10 for BigDecimal
  #
  # == Overriding default Property options
  #
  # There is the ability to reconfigure a Property and it's subclasses by explicitly
  # setting a value in the Property, eg:
  #
  #   # set all String properties to have a default length of 255
  #   DataMapper::Property::String.length(255)
  #
  #   # set all Boolean properties to not allow nil (force true or false)
  #   DataMapper::Property::Boolean.allow_nil(false)
  #
  #   # set all properties to be required by default
  #   DataMapper::Property.required(true)
  #
  #   # turn off auto-validation for all properties by default
  #   DataMapper::Property.auto_validation(false)
  #
  #   # set all mutator methods to be private by default
  #   DataMapper::Property.writer(:private)
  #
  # Please note that this has no effect when a subclass has explicitly
  # defined it's own option. For example, setting the String length to
  # 255 will not affect the Text property even though it inherits from
  # String, because it sets it's own default length to 65535.
  #
  # == Misc. Notes
  # * Properties declared as strings will default to a length of 50, rather than
  #   255 (typical max varchar column size).  To overload the default, pass
  #   <tt>:length => 255</tt> or <tt>:length => 0..255</tt>.  Since DataMapper
  #   does not introspect for properties, this means that legacy database tables
  #   may need their <tt>String</tt> columns defined with a <tt>:length</tt> so
  #   that DM does not apply an un-needed length validation, or allow overflow.
  # * You may declare a Property with the data-type of <tt>Class</tt>.
  #   see SingleTableInheritance for more on how to use <tt>Class</tt> columns.
